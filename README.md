# λογοπαίδεια
The library for SVG logos.

## How to
Downloading an SVG logo is as easy as going to [the site](https://naamahan.github.io/logopedia/), searching for the logo you want, and click the download button. That's it!
The file will be saved in your computer. The naming convention is **Logo - {name}**, so no matter how many logos you download, you can find all of them next to each other.

All downloaded logos are displayed in either of two sizes: 1,024px width for horizontal logos, and 512px height for vertical and square logos.

## About
This is a growing library with the latest logos in SVG format. The way the logos are registered in **λογοπαίδεια** is from their websites, in one of three ways:
+ by collecting the logo resources from the dedicated subpage (e.g., the [Instagram resource center](https://about.meta.com/brand/resources/instagram/instagram-brand/),
+ collecting the SVG file from the brand's homepage, for example:
  - going to the [LEGO](https://www.lego.com/) website,
  - inspecting the logo in the nav,
  - get [the file](https://assets.lego.com/logos/v4.5.0/brand-lego.svg)
+ or by inspecting the website, grabbing the <svg> code (`<svg height="32" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="32"></svg>`) from the source page, adding it to a new svg file, and placing them in the ui software to resize and/or get correct colours.


More logos will be added weekly, and the page will improve so downloading logos is as easy as possible.
